abstract: "Garbled Circuits is a technique used to compute a function based on inputs from
multiple parties without disclosing any data that correlated to the user's
input, except for the output of the function. The technique has been around and
under development for about 30 years, but has only recently seen enough
performance improvements to be feasible for real applications. We detail the
main ideas of the technique, and highlight two recent developments that lead to
performance improvements. The first such improvement, TinyGarble, shows how to
better utilize existing optimization tools used in computer architecture. The
second improvement, called GraphSC, lends support to secure computation of
graph algorithms."
